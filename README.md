Guidelines to BSAN3210 Project Proposal
The course   BSAN3210, Technology of   Business Analytics,   has three assessment   items:   a project   plan(proposal), a   project   report, and a final   examination.   These   notes   outline   my   expectations for the   project   plan or   proposal.
General comments
•          When a   lecturer asks   you   to   describe   a   number   of things   within   your   report   (such   as   the
purpose and significance of your   report) then they will   be   assessing   whether   you   have   done   each of these things. To ensure that they   understand that you   have   done that   then   have
different   paragraphs   (or sections) of your   report   each with   a   different   heading   (eg.   purpose,   significance) so that   it   is   painfully obvious that you   have addressed   each   of these   points.
•          Naming convention for   filenames –   please   call   your   assignment
“BSAN3210_Proposal__”   . You can submit your assignment as   a Word document or a   PDF, whichever you   would   prefer.
Within this assignment you will envision   presenting a   project   plan   to   a   group   of   stakeholders   where you will   be developing a software tool that   could   be   useful   for   your   group   of   stakeholders.   You   do   not   need to   provide your software for this assignment.   Please   provide your   plan for   developing   the software.   For example, you   need to explain which features, variables, functions   you   are   planning   to use for creating the software   in   R. The assignment   demonstrates your   ability   to   use   the   R   programming   language.
You   need to choose one of the   datasets   in   R   as   described   in
https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html 
You are free to choose the   purpose of your   software   and to   define   your   group   of   stakeholders however you want.   For example,   if you are   interested   in   Finance then you   might   choose to   use variables about   residents’   income and to define your   stakeholders   as   Financial Advisors   with   about   10   years of working   experience.
The total   percentage of   marks for course   is   20%.
This   report will   be   in three   parts:
o Part   1 –overall goal.   In this   I   want you   to   describe
•          your group of stakeholders   who   will   be   using your   final   software   tool,
•          a   brief overview of   what   you   want   your   software   tool   to   do   (purpose),
•          why you think this would   be   a   useful tool for   them   (significance).
•          the   dataset you   are   planning   to   use.
•          list of variables   you   are   planning   to   use   and   the   importance   of   including   those   variables
o Part   2 - software   design.   For   this   imagine that   you   are   designing   a   piece   of   software   where   you   will   give your design to a group of   software   developers   so   that   they   can   write   the   code. This   will   need   to include a written description of what you   want   your   software   to   do,   and   a   basic   plot   (drawn   in   a   tool         like   Microsoft   Paint) to   illustrate what you want your computer   interface to   look   like. You   need to provide at   least 4 snapshots of your   proposed software.   (Please   refer   to   the   example   at   the   end   of this file). You can   use different graphical software   for   creating   pictures   of your   software.   At   this   stage   I do   not expect you to do   any   programming   in   R. Just   provide   the   pictures   of your   proposed   sof代 写BSAN3210 Technology of Business AnalyticsC/C++

o Part 3 –review the checklist   of   tasks   I   want   you   to   include   in   your   software   and   for   each   item   tell me where you will   include this   in your software   design.
Your software will   need to   include certain   programming features that we will   discuss   throughout   this   semester
•               File   import and   export
•             Data types – changing variables from   one   data   type   to   another   (eg.   You   might   use   this   to
show one   plot with a variable as   a   continuous variable,   and   then   to   convert   that   variable   into   a categorical variable to show a   different   kind   of   plot)
•             At   least one   looping structure   (eg. for   and while   loops)   (eg.   While   not   the   most   elegant   way   of   doing this you   might   use a   looping structure to add two   vectors   together   one   element   at   a
time, or to   produce a cumulative sum   of the   elements   in   a   vector)
•             At   least one conditional statement   (eg.   If   …   then   …   else   …)   eg.   You   might   have   a   button   in
your software where your software   behaves differently   if the   user   clicks the   button,   or   if the   user chooses different options from   a   drop-down   list).
•             At   least three different widgets for collecting   data   from   a   user   that   will   influence   the   behaviour of the software   (eg. Such as   a   drop-down   list   of   colours to   use   in   a   plot)
•             At   least   one statistical   plot
•             A web   interface   (using   R   Shiny)
Presentation
•          While this   requires just a   little   bit   more than what   other   lecturers   will   ask   of   you,   I   will   ask
that your assignments   have a truly   professional   look   (eg. take a   look   at   the   Annual   Reports from   UQ at https://www.uq.edu.au/about/annual-reports).   In   particular take a   look   at the   title   page, the fonts, and the   use of graphics. To   achieve that for   your   university   assignments   (or at   least your   university assignments with   me) would take   about   an   hour to   set   up   your style. design template, and you could then   use that   template   within   all   of   your   assignments. This   might sound   like a   pedantic   point,   but once you   hit the workforce   all   of   your   report   will      follow that   kind of   professional standard and   so you   may   as   well   get   used   to   doing   that   now. 
•          You   need to   have a title   page with   your   course   code,   your   name,   the   assignment   name,   and   the total word count. You will want to   also   do   something to   pretty   up   that   page   (nice formatting of text, a   pretty   picture on the topic   of your   report).
•          Include   page   numbers,   numbered section   headings,   and   a   table   of   contents.
•          Be very   careful   about   spelling   and grammar,   and   make   sure   to   avoid   slang   and   contractions   (eg. don’t,   can’t).
•          Write   in a creative   and   engaging   way   (eg.   instead   of   calling   your   assignment   the   name   of
“Health and ageing” your   might call   it   “The secrets   of   keeping   healthy   at   an   older   age”). This might   be difficult or   impossible to do   in the technical   sections   of your   text,   but   there   is   a   lot   of   opportunity to do this   in sections   like the   overall goal.
